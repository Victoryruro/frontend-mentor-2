## My process
Started with HTML to get the skeleton of the page , then process to styling with CSS . I styled the desktop design first then the mobile design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned


I learnt the unset value to be very important in web responsiveness



```html
<div>Some HTML code I'm proud of</div>
```
```css
.img .secondimg {
  display: unset;
}
```




### Continued development

I would love to develop my flex skills and CSS skills in general
